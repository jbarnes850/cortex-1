# NEAR Cortex-1: Advanced Crypto Market Reasoning AI

A specialized AI model that combines chain-of-thought reasoning with cross-chain data analysis to understand and predict crypto market dynamics. Built on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B and enhanced through GRPO (Group Policy Optimization), Cortex-1 aims to reason about market dynamics the way experienced traders do, but at a massive scale and with perfect recall of historical patterns spanning from 2018 to present day.

## üí° Open Source Commitment

We believe in the power of open collaboration and are committed to making Cortex-1 fully accessible to the developer community:

- **Open Source Dataset**: Our [hybrid dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jarrodbarnes/cortex-1-market-analysis) combining historical (2018-2023) and real-time data is publicly available, providing developers with high-quality, labeled examples of crypto market reasoning
- **Open Model Weights**: Once trained, the complete model weights will be open-sourced for the community
- **Transparent Development**: All training code, reward functions, and benchmarking tools are open source
- **Developer-First**: Built as a tool for developers to integrate advanced market reasoning into their applications, with the 14B model size specifically chosen to enable local execution on consumer hardware

Our goal is to create a foundation for the community to build upon, whether you're developing trading strategies, market analysis tools, or educational platforms.

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Base Model: Microsoft Phi-4

We chose Microsoft's Phi-4 (14B) as our base model for several key reasons:

- **Accessibility**: 14B parameters can run on consumer hardware (32GB+ RAM, 16GB+ VRAM)
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: Strong performance on mathematics and logical reasoning tasks
- **Context Window**: 16K tokens is sufficient for financial analysis scenarios
- **Quantization-Friendly**: Works efficiently with 4-bit quantization for memory optimization
- **Developer-First**: Enables more contributors to run and fine-tune locally

This choice reinforces our commitment to creating a truly accessible, open-source model that developers can run on their own hardware.

## üîç Hardware Requirements

Cortex-1 is designed to run on accessible hardware:

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| RAM | 32GB | 64GB | Required for data preprocessing |
| GPU | 16GB VRAM | 24GB+ VRAM | A single NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090 or A6000 is sufficient |
