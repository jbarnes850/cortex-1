# NEAR Cortex-1: Advanced Crypto Market Reasoning AI

A specialized AI model that combines chain-of-thought reasoning with cross-chain data analysis to understand and predict crypto market dynamics. Built on Microsoft's Phi-4 (14B) and enhanced through GRPO (Group Policy Optimization), Cortex-1 aims to reason about market dynamics the way experienced traders do, but at a massive scale and with perfect recall of historical patterns.

## üí° Open Source Commitment

We believe in the power of open collaboration and are committed to making Cortex-1 fully accessible to the developer community:

- **Open Source Dataset**: Our synthetic training dataset will be publicly available, providing developers with high-quality, labeled examples of crypto market reasoning
- **Open Model Weights**: Once trained, the complete model weights will be open-sourced for the community
- **Transparent Development**: All training code, reward functions, and benchmarking tools are open source
- **Developer-First**: Built as a tool for developers to integrate advanced market reasoning into their applications

Our goal is to create a foundation for the community to build upon, whether you're developing trading strategies, market analysis tools, or educational platforms.

## üåü Key Features

- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Detailed step-by-step analysis of market conditions
- **Cross-Chain Analysis**: Deep understanding of relationships between different blockchain networks
- **Quantitative Predictions**: Data-driven forecasting with confidence intervals
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of technical, market, and systemic risks
- **Opportunity Detection**: Identification of market inefficiencies and arbitrage opportunities

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Base Model: Microsoft Phi-4

We chose Microsoft's Phi-4 (14B) as our base model for several key reasons:

- **Accessibility**: 14B parameters can run on consumer hardware (32GB+ RAM, 16GB+ VRAM)
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: Strong performance on mathematics and logical reasoning tasks
- **Context Window**: 16K tokens is sufficient for financial analysis scenarios
- **Quantization-Friendly**: Works efficiently with 4-bit quantization for memory optimization
- **Developer-First**: Enables more contributors to run and fine-tune locally

This choice reinforces our commitment to creating a truly accessible, open-source model that developers can run on their own hardware.

## üîç Hardware Requirements

Cortex-1 is designed to run on accessible hardware:

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| RAM | 32GB | 64GB | Required for data preprocessing |
| GPU | 16GB VRAM | 24GB+ VRAM | A single NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090 or A6000 is sufficient |
| CPU | 8 cores | 16+ cores | For data preparation tasks |
| Storage | 100GB SSD | 250GB+ SSD | For datasets and model weights |

With 4-bit quantization, the Phi-4 model requires ~8GB of VRAM for inference and ~16GB for training with small batch sizes, making it feasible to run on a single consumer GPU.
