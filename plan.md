## Crypto Reasoning AI Model Training Plan (70B+ with Unsloth, GRPO & Synthetic Data)

NEAR Cortex-1 is a specialized AI model that can reason, understand, and predict crypto market movements by learning from cross-chain data, then automatically routes capital to the most promising opportunities. Think of it as building an AI that can reason about market dynamics the way experienced traders do, but at a massive scale and with perfect recall of historical patterns.

### 1. Hardware Strategy

- **Local Development (Mac Studio M2 Ultra, 192 GB RAM):**  
  - Use for data preprocessing and debugging.
  - Prototype on reduced capacity models (e.g., 7–13B) to design the pipeline.
  - Orchestrate jobs and run CPU-bound tasks (tokenization, lightweight inference).

- **Cloud GPU Instances:**  
  - Rent high-end GPUs (A100/H100 or similar) for full fine-tuning a 70B+ model.
  - Consider using multi-GPU setups (e.g., 4–8 × A100 80GB) for distributed training using frameworks like DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 or FSDP.
  - Optionally leverage QLoRA (4-bit quantization) to reduce VRAM needs, should full fine-tuning on many GPUs prove challenging.

- **Hybrid Offloading & Cost Management:**  
  - Use the Mac AS an orchestration controller alongside cloud GPUs.
  - Experiment locally with smaller batches and use gradient accumulation.
  - Leverage spot instances/short-term rentals along with frequent checkpointing.

### 2. Model Selection

- **Base Model Recommendation:**  
  - Use **Llama 3.3 70B Instruct** for its excellent reasoning capability and flexibility.
  - This model size is expected to capture complex patterns (especially crucial for DeFi market predictions) while being compatible with Unsloth’s GRPO fine-tuning.

- **Synthetic Data Strategy for Labeling:**  
  - Combine high-fidelity historical data from sources like Flipside with synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) data.
  - Use an LLM to create CoT explanations when manual annotation is prohibitive.
  - For example, for each training sample fetched from Flipside, prompt an LLM (e.g., GPT-4 or another capable model) to generate a detailed reasoning trace that the 70B model can learn from.

  *Pseudocode Overview:*
  
  ```
  for sample in flipside_dataset:
      reasoning = generate_synthetic_reasoning(sample)
      if quality_check(reasoning):
          add_synthetic_label(sample, reasoning)
      else:
          flag_for_review(sample)
  ```

  Incorporating synthetic data in this way increases the volume and diversity of reasoning examples while reducing manual labeling efforts.

### 3. Reward Function Design

- **Primary Objectives:**  
  - **Correctness:** Reward predictions that match the actual market outcomes.
  - **Quality of Reasoning:** Reward detailed and well-structured chain-of-thought explanations.
  - **Penalties:** Deduct points for errors such as spelling mistakes or logical inconsistencies.

- **Example Reward Components:**  
  - **Market Prediction Accuracy:** +1.0 for perfect predictions; use a scaled error metric for numeric predictions.
  - **Chain-of-Thought Depth:** +0.5 for explanations over a certain token threshold; lesser bonus if short.
  - **Quality Checks:** Add rewards for clear logical progression (bonus for including on-chain metrics, news events, etc.) while subtracting for incoherent sentences.

- **Group Policy in GRPO:**  
  - Model generates multiple responses for a given prompt.
  - Every response is scored individually.
  - **Relative scoring** is applied, where responses above the group-average receive positive reinforcement.

*Example Python implementation snippet for the reward function:*

```python:./reward_function.py
def calculate_reward(answer: str, correct_answer: str, chain_of_thought: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculates a composite reward score for a model response.
    
    Reward Strategy:
      - Correct answer gives +1.0.
      - Detailed chain-of-thought: +0.5 if token count > 20, else +0.2.
      - Penalize spelling or grammatical mistakes (-0.1 per error).
      
    Args:
        answer (str): Final prediction.
        correct_answer (str): Ground truth prediction.
        chain_of_thought (str): The reasoning provided.
        
    Returns:
        float: Calculated reward.
    """
    reward = 0.0
    if answer.strip() == correct_answer.strip():
        reward += 1.0

    cot_length = len(chain_of_thought.split())
    reward += 0.5 if cot_length > 20 else 0.2

    # Simple example: Detect common misspellings (expandable)
    spelling_errors = sum(1 for word in chain_of_thought.split() if word.lower() in ["teh", "adn"])
    reward -= spelling_errors * 0.1

    return reward
```

### 4. Fine-Tuning Strategy

- **Dataset Preparation:**  
  - **Historical Data:** Collect and clean high-quality DeFi and crypto data (market conditions, liquidity stats, etc.) via Flipside.
  - **Synthetic Data Integration:**  
    - Use an LLM to generate chain-of-thought reasoning traces for each sample.
    - Validate synthetic labels with automated checks (e.g., minimal token length, coherence heuristics) or a human review loop.

  *Example code for synthetic reasoning generation can be found in the file below:*

  ```python:./synthetic_labeling.py
  import openai

  def construct_prompt(sample: dict) -> str:
      """
      Build a prompt for the LLM that asks for chain-of-thought reasoning.
      
      Args:
          sample (dict): Market data from Flipside.
      
      Returns:
          str: Constructed LLM prompt.
      """
      market_conditions = sample.get("market_conditions", "unspecified conditions")
      price_data = sample.get("price_data", "no price data")
      
      prompt = (
          f"Given the following crypto market data:\n"
          f"Market Conditions: {market_conditions}\n"
          f"Price Data: {price_data}\n\n"
          "Please provide a detailed chain-of-thought explaining the reasoning behind "
          "the observed trends, focusing on cause-effect relationships."
      )
      return prompt

  def generate_reasoning(sample: dict) -> str:
      """
      Generate synthetic chain-of-thought reasoning using an LLM.
      
      Args:
          sample (dict): A market data sample.
      
      Returns:
          str: Generated reasoning.
      """
      prompt = construct_prompt(sample)
      response = openai.Completion.create(
          engine="text-davinci-003",
          prompt=prompt,
          max_tokens=150,
          temperature=0.7
      )
      return response.choices[0].text.strip()
  ```

- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):**  
  - Initially fine-tune Llama 3.3 70B Instruct on the combined real & synthetic dataset using standard cross-entropy loss.
  - Use a very low learning rate (e.g., 1e-5) and monitor validation loss closely, saving checkpoints early.

- **GRPO Reinforcement Fine-Tuning:**  
  - Load the SFT checkpoint into Unsloth’s GRPO pipeline.
  - For each prompt, generate multiple candidate responses (using vLLM for speed) and apply the custom reward function.
  - Use policy gradient updates to reinforce responses that exceed the group-average reward.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  - Explore learning rate (e.g., 1e-6 to 5e-6 during RL phase), batch sizes (number of prompts and responses per batch), and reward scaling methods.
  - Validate with both automated metrics and human review of reasoning quality.

### 5. Training Execution

- **Environment Setup:**  
  - Use cloud infrastructure with high-speed networking if using multiple GPUs.
  - Install required dependencies: Unsloth, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, diffusers, and vLLM.

- **Distributed Training:**  
  - Employ model-parallelism (using DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 or FSDP) to shard the 70B model across cloud GPUs.
  - Utilize gradient accumulation to simulate large batch sizes when memory is limited.

- **Checkpointing & Monitoring:**  
  - Save checkpoints regularly (e.g., every 1000 steps or few hours).
  - Log training metrics (average reward, gradient norms, loss values) for monitoring and debugging.

- **Scalability & Long-Run Considerations:**  
  - Start with a small group size (e.g., 4 candidate responses per prompt) and scale once stable.
  - Use tools like vLLM to dynamically batch generations and optimize GPU usage.
  - Plan for potential failures with robust cluster management and job resumption strategies.

---

### 6. Inference & Deployment

- **Model Export & Quantization:**  
  - After training, export the fine-tuned model (possibly merge LoRA weights if used).
  - Optimize for inference by converting to 4-bit or 8-bit quantized formats using tools like GPTQ.
  - Save in Hugging Face format for easy integration with vLLM.

- **Serving Architecture:**  
  - Deploy using a dedicated cloud GPU instance with vLLM to offer high-throughput, low-latency inference.
  - Wrap the model in a FastAPI (or similar) service that leverages the prompt templates to consistently guide the model’s responses.
  - Ensure the serving solution is containerized (e.g., with Docker) to simplify scaling and updating.

- **Call for Proposals & Community Involvement:**  
  - Open-source the model weights, scripts, and documentation.
  - Publish a detailed README (or whitepaper) explaining the training process, synthetic data generation, and results.
  - Create a “call for proposals” inviting the community to contribute further benchmarks, data improvements, or new use case integrations.

---

### 7. Benchmarking Metrics

- **Prediction Accuracy:**  
  - Evaluate the model on a custom benchmark set (real historical data where outcomes are known).
  - Compute metrics like percentage accuracy and regression error (for numeric predictions).

- **Reasoning Depth & Quality:**  
  - Use chain-of-thought evaluation with both automated heuristics (e.g., explanation length, logical consistency) and human judgment.
  - Consider external benchmarks such as MMLU (finance/economics sections) and Big Bench Hard (BBH) for multi-step reasoning.

- **Computational Efficiency:**  
  - Measure inference throughput (tokens/second) with vLLM.
  - Track latency metrics (time to first token and total response time) as well as memory footprint when running quantized models.
  - Evaluate scalability (e.g., how performance improves with multi-GPU deployment).

- **Robustness & Real-World Performance:**  
  - Test on simulated trading scenarios (backtesting strategy predictions).
  - Monitor consistency across multiple runs and check for safe output behavior under varied inputs.
