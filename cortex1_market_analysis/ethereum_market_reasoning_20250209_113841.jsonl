This additional \u201coverhead\u201d over the base of 113,975 gas is due to the 1.2% failed transactions. In typical smart contract operations, an average gas usage in the 100k\u2013120k range is standard for multifaceted contract calls.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003Monitoring changes in this ratio over time can help diagnose inefficiencies or increases in contract complexity.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nc) Cost Structure: Gas Fee Relative to Transaction Value  \n\u2003\u2022 Assumption:  \n\u2003Average Gas Price is provided as \u201c2\u201d.

Under a 15M gas limit assumption, the network is running at about 90% of its capacity each day\u2014a busy indicator that may push the network close to its limits. Alternatively, a higher gas limit would depict more slack. In a healthy network, utilization in the range of 50%\u201380% (without congestion) is ideal, but higher utilization can be acceptable if it does not delay block processing.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003If average utilization approaches capacity limits, scaling solutions or fee adjustments might be needed to maintain smooth operations. Monitoring is essential.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nb) Distribution of Value (Gini Coefficient Approximation)  \n\u2003\u2022 Discussion:  \n\u2003A precise Gini coefficient requires detailed distribution data for transaction values (i.e., each individual transaction\u2019s amount). With only the average transaction value (\u22480.922688 ETH) available, we can only note that many blockchain systems exhibit a power-law distribution; that is, a small number of \u201cwhale\u201d transactions coexist with many smaller transfers.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Speculative Estimate:  \n\u2003Based on historical patterns in decentralized networks, the Gini coefficient might range between 0.6 and 0.8. A higher value would imply that a relatively small group of users or contracts is responsible for a large percentage of the volume.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003Wallets, dApp developers, and protocol designers might benefit from measures that promote broader participation if value concentration is high. More granular data would be required for precise analysis.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nc) Smart Contract Adoption Rate  \n\u2003\u2022 Calculation (revisited):  \n\u2003\u2003Smart Contract Adoption Rate = Contract Interactions \u00f7 Daily Transactions  \n\u2003\u2003= 493,462 \u00f7 767,107  \n\u2003\u2003\u2248 64.3% [Smart_Contract_Adoption]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \nA 64.3% adoption rate indicates that a large majority of transactions are interacting with smart contracts, reflecting a mature dApp ecosystem and a high degree of network programmability. Healthy networks often see contract usage above 50% as more applications come online.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003This strong adoption suggests that future innovations (e.g., cross-chain bridges and NFT platforms) are likely to succeed on this network.

Users make on average nearly 3 transactions per day, and a success rate of 98.8% ensures that close to 758,000 transactions are effectively processed daily.  \n2. Over 64% of transactions involve smart contracts, indicating strong dApp and DeFi activity.  \n3. Economic activity is robust, with roughly 699,307 ETH moved successfully per day. Gas fees represent only about 0.025% of each transaction\u2019s value, translating to an average daily user cost of about 0.000665 ETH (~$1.33 with ETH at $2,000), making the network very cost-efficient.  \n4. Depending on the assumed block gas limit, network utilization ranges from under 50% to nearly 90%; close to full capacity under tighter limits suggests ongoing attention to scaling may be required.  \n5. Although we cannot compute an exact Gini coefficient without detailed value distributions, the network likely exhibits typical concentration, and higher smart contract adoption further supports innovative growth.  \n6. An economic efficiency score of over 4,000 (ETH value moved per ETH spent on gas) signals that the network is moving vast amounts of value very cost-effectively.\n\nBy tracking these metrics over time, network participants\u2014from developers to institutional users\u2014can make informed decisions about scaling, security, and new service design while alerting policy-makers to any shifts in network health."}

Impact of Success Rate on Throughput  \n\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003Effective Successful Transactions = Daily Transactions \u00d7 Success Rate  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 1,203,788 \u00d7 0.987  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 1,188,139 successful transactions [success_throughput]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003A 98.7% success rate means that nearly all transactions are executed as intended. This high rate reinforces network reliability and user trust, ensuring that nearly 1.19 million transactions per day truly take effect.\n\n1c. Smart Contract Interaction Density  \n\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003Contract Interaction Density = Contract Interactions / Daily Transactions  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 763,744 / 1,203,788  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 0.6347, or about 63.5% [contract_interaction_density]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003Almost 64% of all transactions involve smart contracts. This is a strong signal of mature decentralized application (dApp) usage\u2014covering DeFi, NFTs, and other protocols\u2014compared to typical periods when contract interactions might range between 30% and 70%.\n\n1d. Ratio of Unique Receivers to Unique Users  \n\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003Receiver-to-User Ratio = Unique Receivers / Unique Users  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 234,584 / 408,696  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 0.5739, or about 57.4% [receiver_user_ratio]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003About 57% of users are acting as receivers. While many users might play both roles (sender and receiver), this figure suggests that funds are not evenly distributed among all users. In a highly decentralized scenario, one might expect a higher receiver percentage, but in practice, some clustering (for example, via centralized dApps or popular contract addresses) is common.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nII. Economic Metrics Analysis\n\n2a. Total Economic Value Moved (Adjusted for Success)  \n\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003Effective Transferred Volume = Total Volume \u00d7 Success Rate  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 1,875,000.98 ETH \u00d7 0.987  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 1,875,000.98 ETH \u2013 (1,875,000.98 ETH \u00d7 0.013)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 1,875,000.98 ETH \u2013 24,375.01 ETH  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 1,850,625.97 ETH [economic_value_moved]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003After accounting for the 1.3% of failed transactions, approximately 1,850,626 ETH in value transfers actually occur. This adjusted figure represents the true \u201ceconomic throughput\u201d of the network.\n\n2b. Gas Efficiency Ratio (Gas Used per Successful Transaction)  \n\u2003\u2022 Reasoning:  \n\u2003\u2003Although the \u201cAverage Gas Used\u201d of 108,273 is per transaction, unsuccessful transactions still consume gas. To account for this, we adjust the value to reflect the cost per successful transaction.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003Effective Average Gas per Successful Transaction = Average Gas Used / Success Rate  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 108,273 / 0.987  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 109,690 gas units [gas_efficiency_ratio]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003This adjusted figure shows that when accounting for the small proportion of failed transactions, on average about 109,690 gas units are \u201cspent\u201d per successful transaction. This metric helps developers and analysts gauge the real cost of operations, slightly higher than the nominal average.\n\n2c. Cost Structure (Fee as a Fraction of Transaction Value)  \n\u2003\u2022 Note on Units:  \n\u2003\u2003Average Gas Price is given as 2. In Ethereum, gas prices are commonly denoted in Gwei. Given 1 ETH = 1\u00d710\u2079 Gwei, a gas price of 2 Gwei converts to 2\u00d710\u207b\u2079 ETH per gas unit.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Calculation \u2013 Step 1: Find the Average Transaction Fee in ETH  \n\u2003\u2003Average Fee = Average Gas Used \u00d7 (Gas Price in ETH)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 108,273 \u00d7 2\u00d710\u207b\u2079  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 216,546\u00d710\u207b\u2079 ETH  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.000216546 ETH\n\n\u2003\u2022 Calculation \u2013 Step 2: Compute Fee-to-Value Ratio  \n\u2003\u2003Fee Ratio = (Average Fee) / (Average Transaction Value)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.000216546 ETH / 1.557584 ETH  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 0.0001392, or 0.01392% [cost_structure_ratio]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003Only about 0.014% of the average transaction\u2019s value is consumed in fees. This extremely low cost structure is very attractive compared to periods of network congestion when fees can be a significant burden for users.\n\n2d. Projected Daily Network Costs per User  \n\u2003\u2022 Calculation \u2013 Step 1: Estimate Total Daily Gas Fees  \n\u2003\u2003Total Daily Gas Fees = Daily Transactions \u00d7 Average Fee  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 1,203,788 \u00d7 0.000216546 ETH  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 260.68 ETH [daily_network_costs_total]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Calculation \u2013 Step 2: Average Fee per User  \n\u2003\u2003Cost per User = Total Daily Gas Fees / Unique Users  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 260.68 ETH / 408,696  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 0.0006375 ETH per user per day [daily_network_costs_user]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003On average, each user pays roughly 0.00064 ETH daily in transaction fees\u2014a very low cost that encourages frequent, everyday use.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nIII. Market Health Indicators\n\n3a. Network Utilization Rate  \n\u2003\u2022 Method:  \n\u2003\u2003A common way to estimate utilization is by comparing the total gas used in a day with the network\u2019s theoretical maximum. Assume:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Block Gas Limit \u2248 30,000,000 gas units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Blocks per Day \u2248 14,400 (roughly one block every 6 seconds)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Maximum Daily Gas = 30,000,000 \u00d7 14,400 = 432,000,000,000 gas units\n\n\u2003\u2022 Calculation \u2013 Step 1: Compute Total Gas Used Daily  \n\u2003\u2003Total Gas Used = Daily Transactions \u00d7 Average Gas Used  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 1,203,788 \u00d7 108,273  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 130,337,738,124 gas units [daily_total_gas]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Calculation \u2013 Step 2: Utilization Rate  \n\u2003\u2003Utilization Rate = Total Gas Used / Maximum Daily Gas  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 130,337,738,124 / 432,000,000,000  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 0.302, or 30.2% [network_utilization_rate]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003Operating at roughly 30% of total capacity indicates that the network is far from congestion. This headroom supports scalability and can help keep fees low even if transaction numbers rise.\n\n3b. Distribution of Value \u2013 Gini Coefficient Approximation  \n\u2003\u2022 Discussion and Approximation:  \n\u2003\u2003A full Gini calculation requires detailed data on each account\u2019s holdings and transaction volumes, which is not provided here. However, an indirect look can be taken based on the receiver-to-user ratio of 57.4% [receiver_user_ratio].  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 A scenario where nearly every user were receiving funds would push this ratio closer to 100%.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 A lower ratio may hint at concentration\u2014perhaps a number of \u201chub\u201d addresses (e.g., popular dApps or exchanges) receiving much of the flow.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Significance:  \n\u2003\u2003While we cannot assign an exact Gini coefficient, a rough expectation might be in the moderate range (e.g., 0.5\u20130.6) indicating some inequality in value distribution. Actionable insight: Enhanced transparency and more granular data can help stakeholders address any undue concentration.\n\n3c. Smart Contract Adoption Rate  \n\u2003\u2022 Calculation (revisited):  \n\u2003\u2003Smart Contract Adoption Rate = Contract Interactions / Daily Transactions  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 763,744 / 1,203,788 \u2248 63.5% [contract_interaction_density]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003A 63.5% rate of contract interactions signals robust dApp activity. This level is well above earlier network phases when such interactions were lower, confirming that the ecosystem is maturing and that decentralized protocols are enjoying broad adoption.\n\n3d. Network Economic Efficiency Score  \n\u2003\u2022 Definition:  \n\u2003\u2003Economic Efficiency here can be seen as the amount of effective economic volume moved per ETH paid in gas fees.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Calculation \u2013 Step 1: Confirm Effective Economic Throughput  \n\u2003\u2003Effective Volume Moved = ~1,850,626 ETH [economic_value_moved]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Calculation \u2013 Step 2: Determine Total Daily Gas Fees in ETH  \n\u2003\u2003Total Gas Fees = Total Gas Used \u00d7 (Gas Price in ETH)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 130,337,738,124 \u00d7 2\u00d710\u207b\u2079  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 260.68 ETH [daily_network_costs_total]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Calculation \u2013 Step 3: Efficiency Score  \n\u2003\u2003Economic Efficiency Score = Effective Volume Moved / Total Gas Fees  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 1,850,626 ETH / 260.68 ETH  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 7,096 [economic_efficiency_score]\n\n\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003This score means that for every 1 ETH spent on fees, roughly 7,096 ETH in value is transferred. A high score underlines the network\u2019s ability to move vast amounts of value at minimal cost\u2014a key positive signal compared to periods when high fees erode economic throughput.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nActionable Insights\n\n\u2022 Users & Developers:  \n\u2003\u2013 With an average of nearly 3 transactions per user and extremely low fee-to-transaction value ratios (\u22480.014%), participants can enjoy a cost\u2010efficient environment.  \n\u2003\u2013 The high smart contract adoption (\u224863.5%) suggests that creating and interacting with dApps is now a mainstream activity; developers should continue innovating in these areas.\n\n\u2022 Network Operators & Planners:  \n\u2003\u2013 The network\u2019s current utilization at approximately 30% of maximum daily capacity implies significant headroom. This can inform scaling strategies and fee market stability measures to accommodate increased adoption.  \n\u2003\u2013 Although the indirect value distribution measure hints at some concentration, collecting more granular data can aid in making policies to foster greater decentralization.\n\n\u2022 Analysts & Researchers:  \n\u2003\u2013 The computed Economic Efficiency Score of about 7,096 is a benchmark for comparing future improvements or periods of congestion. Maintaining low transaction fees relative to volume is crucial for long\u2010term network growth.  \n\u2003\u2013 Further investigation into account-level distributions is recommended to refine the estimation of the Gini coefficient and better understand wealth concentration.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion\n\nThis snapshot from February 8, 2025, reveals a network that is robust, efficient, and highly engaged:  \n\u2022 Approximately 2.94 transactions per user demonstrate steady activity.  \n\u2022 A success rate of 98.7% ensures near-universal transaction efficacy.  \n\u2022 High smart contract interaction density (63.5%) reflects a maturing dApp ecosystem.  \n\u2022 Economic throughput adjusted for fees is exceptionally high (efficiency score ~7,096), while network fees remain negligible for individual users (<0.001 ETH daily).  \n\u2022 Network utilization at 30% of theoretical capacity suggests ample scalability.\n\nEach of these insights provides clear, data-driven pathways for further optimization and strategic planning."}
