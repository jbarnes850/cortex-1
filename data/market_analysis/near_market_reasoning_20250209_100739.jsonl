In practice, fee mechanisms on NEAR usually use sub-denomination conversions. It is advisable for network designers to ensure that fee structures (or fee rebates/subsidies) are tuned so that processing a microtransaction does not incur disproportionate costs.\n\n\u2003d) Projecting Daily Network Costs for an Average User  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Data:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003User Engagement = 7.33 transactions per user (from part 1a)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Transaction Cost (gas fee) = 168 (as above)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Average User\u2019s Daily Cost = Engagement Ratio \u00d7 Transaction Cost  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 7.33 \u00d7 168  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 1,231.44 (in the same gas fee units)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Explanation & Significance:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003This figure represents the cumulative \u201cgas cost\u201d per active user per day. If these fee units were directly comparable to NEAR token units, it would be extremely burdensome relative to an average transaction value.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003However, since blockchain fee values are often denominated in very small units compared to the token (NEAR uses yoctoNEAR for fee calculations), the apparent high number likely reflects scaling rather than actual cost burden in NEAR.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Users should be aware of how the fee mechanism converts gas units to NEAR tokens. Developers and protocol designers, meanwhile, should ensure transparency in fee calculation and consider fee-bundling techniques that mitigate any perceived burden on microtransaction users.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3.

On its face, this number is very small. However, because gas fee \u201ccost units\u201d are typically in a smaller denomination (e.g., yoctoNEAR) while the token amounts are in NEAR, this ratio reflects the network\u2019s emphasis on high throughput microtransactions rather than large-value transfers.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003If the goal is to improve economic efficiency, one strategy may be to aggregate several microtransactions when possible. For developers and business users, understanding this ratio can help in designing applications that optimize fee expenditure relative to the value transferred.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nSummary & Actionable Recommendations\n\n\u2022 The network shows strong reliability (100% success), ample throughput (\u224848 TPS with low utilization relative to capacity), and an active user base (\u22487.33 tx per user).  \n\u2022 However, the overall economic volume is very low compared to the sheer number of transactions, highlighting a microtransaction use case: almost every transaction moves only about 0.000595 NEAR.  \n\u2022 The cost structure\u2014when computed as gas_price \u00d7 gas_used relative to the tiny average transaction value\u2014appears disproportionate; this emphasizes the importance of understanding unit conversions in NEAR\u2019s fee mechanism. Stakeholders should ensure that fee calculations remain favorable for microtransactions (for example, via batching or subsidized fees).  \n\u2022 Smart contract usage accounts for less than 1% of transactions. While this might be acceptable for a network focused on simple transfers, developers interested in building dApps could work with the ecosystem to stimulate increased contract interactions.  \n\u2022 Finally, the broad distribution of transaction endpoints (a receivers-to-users ratio of 3.83) is a positive indicator of decentralization, and the approximated low Gini coefficient suggests an equitable spread of economic activity.\n\nFor users, developers, and network incentivizers, the key takeaway is that NEAR on this day is operating reliably and efficiently for high-volume, low-value transactions. To further enhance economic viability, efforts might focus on:\n\u2003\u2013 Optimizing fee structures and exploring transaction bundling techniques  \n\u2003\u2013 Introducing incentives to drive deeper smart contract/dApp engagement  \n\u2003\u2013 Continuing to monitor user activity distribution to ensure growing, equitable participation\n\nThis thorough, numerically precise breakdown can serve as a basis for further strategic decisions in addressing network economics and market health on NEAR."}

Let\u2019s break this down into the three requested sections.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n1. Network Activity Analysis\n\n\u2003a) User Engagement Ratio  \n\u2003\u2003Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Engagement ratio = Daily Transactions / Unique Users  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 7,335,802 / 829,661  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 8.84 transactions per user  \n\n\u2003\u2003Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003On average each active user is responsible for roughly 8.84 transactions per day. This indicates moderate-to-high engagement especially for a system handling micro-transfers. In many healthy blockchains with microtransaction use cases, a value in this ball\u2010park suggests that while users are active, each individual action is very small.\n\n\u2003b) Impact of 100% Success Rate on Throughput  \n\u2003\u2003Observation:  \n\u2003\u2003A 100.0% success rate means that every submitted transaction is successfully executed.  \n\u2003\u2003Implication:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The effective transaction throughput equals the raw throughput (7,335,802 transactions).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 This shows low congestion, reliable execution, and minimal wastage of resources (i.e. no gas is \u201cwasted\u201d on failures).  \n\u2003\u2003Comparison:  \n\u2003\u2003Many networks under heavy load see a fraction of transactions fail, so a 100% rate is an excellent sign of stability.\n\n\u2003c) Contract Interaction Density Relative to Total Transactions  \n\u2003\u2003Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Density = Contract Interactions / Total Transactions  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 26,479 / 7,335,802  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 0.00361, or about 0.36%  \n\n\u2003\u2003Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003Only about 0.36% of all transactions involve contract interactions. This is very low, implying that nearly all transactions are simple transfers rather than smart\u2010contract calls.  \n\u2003\u2003Implication:  \n\u2003\u2003If the network\u2019s vision is to host robust dApps, there is room to improve smart contract adoption. In many maturing ecosystems, a higher share of transactions are contract calls reflecting active dApp usage.\n\n\u2003d) Unique Receivers to Unique Users Ratio  \n\u2003\u2003Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Ratio = Unique Receivers / Unique Users  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 3,371,208 / 829,661  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 4.06  \n\n\u2003\u2003Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003On average, for every active user there are about 4 distinct receiver addresses. This suggests that the funds moved on the network are distributed over a broad set of accounts \u2013 an indicator of wide network distribution rather than centralized or \u201chub\u2010and\u2010spoke\u201d flows.  \n\u2003\u2003Implication:  \n\u2003\u2003This can be seen as a sign of decentralization in transfers; however, if most transactions are extremely small, one might need to encourage higher-value interactions for more sustainable economic activity.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2. Economic Metrics Analysis\n\n\u2003a) Total Economic Value Moved  \n\u2003\u2003Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003Since Success Rate is 100%, the effective volume is:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Effective value = Total Volume \u00d7 Success Rate  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 4,374.04 NEAR \u00d7 1.00  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 4,374.04 NEAR\n\n\u2003\u2003Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003Even though over 7.3 million transactions occurred, the total value moved is only 4,374.04 NEAR. This, in tandem with an average transaction value of 0.000596 NEAR, confirms that these are micro-transactions.  \n\u2003\u2003Implication:  \n\u2003\u2003For users and applications, the network is being used for very small-value transfers; aggregating transactions might be beneficial if larger sums are needed.\n\n\u2003b) Gas Efficiency Ratio (Gas Used per Successful Transaction)  \n\u2003\u2003Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003Since every transaction is successful and the reported average gas use is 6, the ratio is simply:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Gas efficiency = 6 gas units per transaction.  \n\u2003\u2003Total gas used (daily) = 7,335,802 \u00d7 6 = 44,014,812 gas units.\n\n\u2003\u2003Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003A very low gas usage per transaction indicates that the network is highly efficient in its consumption of computational resources.  \n\u2003\u2003Comparison:  \n\u2003\u2003Other blockchains, such as Ethereum, typically require thousands of gas units for many operations. The NEAR network\u2019s efficiency here supports models that rely on high-frequency, low-value transactions.\n\n\u2003c) Cost Structure Evaluation (Fee per Transaction vs. Transaction Value)  \n\u2003\u2003Step 1. Calculate Fee per Transaction:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Fee = Average Gas Used \u00d7 Average Gas Price  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 6 \u00d7 30  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 180 (in fee units)\n\n\u2003\u2003Step 2. Compute Fee-to-Value Ratio:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Ratio = (Fee per Transaction) / (Average Transaction Value)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 180 / 0.000596  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 302,010\n\n\u2003\u2003Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003This number tells us that, on average, the fee \u201ccost\u201d is over 300,000 times the average transaction\u2019s value. At face value in the provided units, the fee overhead looks enormous relative to the value transferred.  \n\u2003\u2003Note: In practice, these numbers may be expressed in different units (for example, gas price might be quoted in sub-units of NEAR). However, if taken as is, this incongruity warns us that fee mechanisms must be carefully balanced when handling micro-payments.\n\n\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 If fees are charged directly in these units, the network could be unsustainable for microtransactions.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 It may be necessary to implement fee subsidies, batch transactions, or adjust the gas pricing model to better suit the micro-value context.\n\n\u2003d) Daily Network Costs for Average Users  \n\u2003\u2003Step 1. Recall the Average Transactions per User:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003= 8.84 (from part 1a)\n\n\u2003\u2003Step 2. Compute Daily Fee per User:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Fee (per tx) = 180  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Daily Fee per Average User = 8.84 \u00d7 180  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 1,591.2 fee units\n\n\u2003\u2003Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003Each average user, performing around 8\u20139 transactions per day, \u201cpays\u201d a cumulative fee of about 1,591.2 units.  \n\u2003\u2003Implication:  \n\u2003\u2003Without an appropriate conversion factor to standard NEAR units\u2014or without fee optimization\u2014the fee burden per user appears very high compared to their microtransaction\u2019s intrinsic value.  \n\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003Reviewing and potentially reducing fee costs will be crucial to ensure that everyday users are not discouraged by high transaction overheads.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3. Market Health Indicators\n\n\u2003a) Network Utilization Rate  \n\u2003\u2003Definition and Discussion:  \n\u2003\u2003Network utilization rate is often defined as the ratio of the actual throughput (in transactions or gas usage) to the network\u2019s maximum throughput capacity. Although the maximum capacity is not provided here, we note the following:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Total daily gas consumption is 44,014,812 units.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The extremely low average gas consumption per transaction (6 units) coupled with a 100% success rate implies that the network is not congested.  \n\n\u2003\u2003Qualitative Inference:  \n\u2003\u2003If, for example, the network were capable of handling, say, 100,000,000 gas units a day, then the utilization would be approximately  \n\u2003\u2003\u200344,014,812 / 100,000,000 \u2248 44%,  \n\u2003\u2003which is very healthy.  \n\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003There is ample spare capacity. With further adoption (especially of smart contract\u2013based applications), the network can scale without immediately risking congestion.\n\n\u2003b) Distribution of Value \u2013 Gini Coefficient Approximation  \n\u2003\u2003Discussion:  \n\u2003\u2003A complete Gini coefficient calculation would require the full distribution of transaction values across accounts. However, we can note the following:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The average transaction value is extremely low (0.000596 NEAR).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The fact that there are over 7.3 million transactions but only 4,374.04 NEAR transferred in total suggests that many transactions are of similar small value\u2014unless a tiny subset of transactions are several orders of magnitude larger.  \n\u2003\u2003Inference:  \n\u2003\u2003Without full distribution data, we suspect that the value distribution is highly fragmented. If a few addresses are responsible for concentrated higher value transfers, the \u201cinequality\u201d (and hence the Gini coefficient) could be high.  \n\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003Monitoring the detailed distribution will be important. A highly concentrated value flow may indicate that a small number of nodes or dApps dominate, which could pose centralization risks.\n\n\u2003c) Smart Contract Adoption Rate  \n\u2003\u2003Calculation (as in 1c):  \n\u2003\u2003Contract interaction ratio = 26,479 / 7,335,802 \u2248 0.36%  \n\u2003\u2003Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003This very low percentage indicates that smart contract calls are currently a small fraction of overall network activity.  \n\u2003\u2003Implication:  \n\u2003\u2003For a blockchain that aims to host decentralized applications, increasing this percentage is essential to drive innovation and a broader utility.  \n\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003Stakeholders and developers might consider incentivizing smart contract usage, potentially by offering lower fees or market development programs to integrate dApps into everyday use.\n\n\u2003d) Network Economic Efficiency Score  \n\u2003\u2003Definition and Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003One way to define an \u201ceconomic efficiency\u201d metric for each transaction is to compare the value moved to the fee paid. In our case:  \n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Efficiency = (Average Transaction Value) / (Fee per Transaction)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.000596 / (6 \u00d7 30)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.000596 / 180  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 3.31 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076\n\n\u2003\u2003Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003This means that for every \u201cunit\u201d of fee cost paid, only about 3.31 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 NEAR of value is transferred. In microtransaction-based networks one expects fees to be a tiny fraction of the value moved; here the ratio is very low if the fee units are directly comparable to NEAR.  \n\u2003\u2003Implication:  \n\u2003\u2003If fees are not adjusted relative to the actual value transferred, users might find that the cost of transacting far outweighs the benefits, especially as the average transaction value is in the micro range.  \n\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003This metric suggests an urgent need to reexamine fee structures\u2014either by reducing gas prices, optimizing gas usage further, or enabling fee-burn/subsidy models for micropayments\u2014to improve overall economic efficiency.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nOverall Actionable Insights\n\n1. Although the NEAR network is carrying over 7 million transactions per day with impeccable execution (100% success), most transactions are micro in value. This suggests that while the network is technically efficient, the economic model may need to aggregate value or reduce fees to better suit its use\u2010case.\n\n2. With contract interactions at only 0.36% of all transactions, there is significant untapped potential for dApp development. Stakeholders should work to boost smart contract adoption\u2014through targeted incentives, lowering smart contract deployment costs, or developer grant programs\u2014in order to enhance the network\u2019s utility.\n\n3. The fee cost per transaction (when compared with the minuscule average transaction value) appears disproportionately high. This calls for a rethinking of fee mechanisms. Possibilities include fee subsidies for microtransactions, batching numerous micro-transactions into a single fee, or revising the gas pricing model to better align with the network\u2019s economic realities.\n\n4. The ratio of unique receivers to users (\u22484.06) and the relatively low gas consumption indicate that, from a technical perspective, the network is well under its capacity. This is a promising sign for future scaling; however, economic adjustments will be key to incentivize more meaningful value transfers.\n\nIn summary, while the NEAR network on 2025\u201102\u201108 demonstrates stellar stability and efficiency in handling high transaction volumes at low computational cost, its microtransaction use\u2013case currently suffers from an economic imbalance between fees and transaction values. Addressing these fee and economic efficiency challenges, and further spurring smart contract adoption, will underpin the network\u2019s broader market health and long\u2011term sustainability."}
