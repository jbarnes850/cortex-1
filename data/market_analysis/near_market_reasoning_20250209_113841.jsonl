Network Activity Analysis\n\n\u2003A. User Engagement Ratio (daily_txns / unique_users)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Daily Transactions = 4,460,392 [Daily_Transactions]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Unique Users = 592,966 [Unique_Users]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Ratio = 4,460,392 / 592,966 \u2248 7.52  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003On average, each unique user initiates about 7.52 transactions per day. Such a ratio implies that users are engaging multiple times daily\u2014even though each transaction is very small in value.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003In a healthy network, multiple daily interactions can be seen as a sign of an active user base. However, because the average transaction value is only 0.000596 NEAR [Average_Transaction_Value], product strategies may consider ways to drive higher\u2010value or more \u201ccomplex\u201d interactions.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Encourage dApps or payment flows that aggregate micro\u2010transactions or evolve into higher\u2010value use cases to improve economic impact.\n\n\u2003B. Success Rate\u2019s Impact on Throughput  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Given: Success Rate = 100.0% [Success_Rate]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Explanation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003A 100% success rate means every submitted transaction is processed successfully. In effect, the effective throughput in terms of successful transactions is the full 4,460,392 daily transactions.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003High operational reliability is a key sign of network stability. Most mature blockchains aim for very high success rates, so 100% is positive.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Maintain current performance under load and monitor for periods when the rate might drop\u2014this will ensure continuous smooth user experience.\n\n\u2003C. Contract Interaction Density Relative to Total Transactions  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Contract Interactions = 26,637 [Contract_Interactions]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Ratio = 26,637 / 4,460,392 \u2248 0.00597 (or about 0.6%)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Only about 0.6% of transactions invoke smart contracts. The remaining ~99.4% are likely simple transfers or basic operations.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Healthy blockchains that foster ecosystems of dApps sometimes see higher contract-interaction ratios. A low percentage may indicate that the network\u2019s current use is more oriented toward transfers rather than decentralized applications.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: To boost smart contract adoption, consider enhanced developer support, more intuitive dApp experiences, or incentives for contract-based activities.\n\n\u2003D. Unique Receivers to Unique Users Ratio  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Unique Receivers = 2,289,864 [Unique_Receivers]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Ratio = 2,289,864 / 592,966 \u2248 3.86  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003On average, each user is transacting with about 3.86 distinct receivers. This indicates a relatively wide distribution of funds, suggesting that users are not limiting their interactions to a handful of addresses.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003A higher ratio can be a sign of a decentralized or broadly distributed network. It also may imply that many users are either paying different recipients or using multiple ephemeral addresses.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Analyze on-chain address usage further to verify whether a high unique receiver count is driven by genuine economic activity or by script/bot behaviors.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2. Economic Metrics Analysis\n\n\u2003A. Total Economic Value Moved  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Since the success rate is 100%, the value moved is simply the reported Total Volume.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Total Volume = 2,660.35 NEAR [Total_Volume]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Economic Value Moved = 2,660.35 NEAR \u00d7 1 = 2,660.35 NEAR  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Over 2,660 NEAR were transferred in total. With an average transaction value of only 0.000596 NEAR, it is clear that most transactions are micro-value transfers.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003While high transaction counts are healthy from a volume standpoint, the economic \u201cweight\u201d per transaction is very low.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Explore mechanisms to bundle micro-transactions or enhance transaction values to better capture economic significance.\n\n\u2003B. Gas Efficiency Ratio (average gas used per successful transaction)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Given:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Average Gas Used = 6 [Average_Gas_Used]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Since every transaction is successful, the efficiency ratio is simply 6 gas units per transaction.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Total Daily Gas Used (for perspective):  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 6 gas units \u00d7 4,460,392 transactions \u2248 26,762,352 gas units   \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Each transaction on average consumes very few gas units. Operationally, this implies a low resource cost per transaction.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Low gas consumption per transaction is a positive sign for scalability, as long as gas price adjustments keep fees economical.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Monitor for any changes in average gas use under higher load scenarios to maintain low per-transaction costs.\n\n\u2003C. Cost Structure Evaluation (gas_price * gas_used / transaction_value)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation Steps:  \n\u2003\u2003\u20031. Compute per-transaction fee in \u201cgas cost units\u201d:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Gas Price = 28 [Average_Gas_Price] and Gas Used = 6  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Fee = 28 \u00d7 6 = 168  \n\u2003\u2003\u20032. Compare fee to Average Transaction Value:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Average Transaction Value = 0.000596 NEAR [Average_Transaction_Value]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Cost Ratio = 168 / 0.000596 \u2248 281,879.19  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003This number suggests that, in our \u201craw\u201d unit comparison, the fee component (168 \u201cgas units\u201d) is about 282,000 times larger than the transaction\u2019s reported value.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Caveat & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Such a huge ratio is an immediate red flag if the gas fee were denominated in the same NEAR units as the transaction value. In practice, blockchain systems often use gas units and prices expressed in submultiples (for example, yoctoNEAR) that are then converted to a human\u2010friendly cost. Therefore, it is likely that \u201828\u2019 and \u20186\u2019 are scaled measures not directly comparable to the 0.000596 NEAR average value.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Revisit the fee model to ensure that the unit conversion between gas pricing and NEAR values is understood. If fee \u201cburdens\u201d are indeed high relative to the value being transacted, consider fee adjustments or batching techniques for micro-transactions.\n\n\u2003D. Daily Network Costs for Average Users  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation Approach:  \n\u2003\u2003\u20031. Average transactions per user \u2248 7.52 (from part 1.A)  \n\u2003\u2003\u20032. Fee per transaction (in gas cost units) = 168 (from part 2.C)  \n\u2003\u2003\u20033. Average daily fee per user = 7.52 \u00d7 168 \u2248 1,263.36  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003On a daily basis, each user \u201cincurs\u201d approximately 1,263.36 fee units.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003When the average transaction moves only 0.000596 NEAR, this level of fee \u201ccost\u201d (if directly comparable after conversion) appears disproportionate.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Examine the unit conversion between gas cost units and NEAR and explore mechanisms (like fee subsidies or improved gas pricing) if fees are unduly high relative to transferred values.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n3. Market Health Indicators\n\n\u2003A. Network Utilization Rate  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Discussion:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Without an explicitly stated network capacity (i.e., maximum transactions per day), one way to gauge utilization is through observed stability and success rates.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003The 4,460,392 daily transactions and the 100% success rate indicate that the network is operating with low congestion.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 A Rough Estimate (Hypothetical):  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003If we assume a healthy maximum capacity of, for example, 10,000,000 transactions per day, then Utilization = 4,460,392 / 10,000,000 \u2248 44.6%.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003A mid-range utilization rate allows the network to absorb growth while maintaining high throughput.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Continue to monitor transaction volumes so that if utilization climbs too high (potentially reducing success rates), capacity upgrades or load-balancing measures are triggered.\n\n\u2003B. Distribution of Value (Gini Coefficient Approximation)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Discussion:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003With the total volume of 2,660.35 NEAR spread over 4,460,392 transactions, the average transaction value is a near-constant 0.000596 NEAR.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003If nearly every transaction were the same size, this would imply very low inequality in transaction values (a Gini coefficient near 0).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Caution:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003In real networks, some users make larger transfers. However, based solely on the provided averages, the picture is that of many micro-transactions with little variation.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003A uniform spread of micro-transactions tends toward an equitable distribution; however, the presence of occasional large transfers (not resolved by these summary statistics) could skew this.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Obtain granular transaction data for constructing an accurate Lorenz curve to determine if there is hidden concentration of volume.\n\n\u2003C. Smart Contract Adoption Rate  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation Recap:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Smart contract interactions as a percentage of all transactions = 26,637 / 4,460,392 \u2248 0.6% (from part 1.C)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Only a small fraction of transactions are smart contract\u2013based, suggesting that the network\u2019s dApp ecosystem is either nascent or that most activity is limited to simple transfers.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Comparison & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Other leading networks aiming for rich dApp ecosystems might exhibit a higher percentage.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: Consider incentivizing smart contract usage through development grants or marketing campaigns to foster an ecosystem that supports more complex interactions.\n\n\u2003D. Economic Efficiency Score  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Proposed Metric:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003One way to capture economic efficiency is to compare the economic value moved to the total \u201cgas cost\u201d incurred. Define:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003EES = Total Volume Moved / (Gas Price \u00d7 Gas Used \u00d7 Daily Transactions)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u20031. Total \u201cfee cost\u201d per transaction = 28 \u00d7 6 = 168 [from part 2.C]  \n\u2003\u2003\u20032. Total fee cost for the day = 168 \u00d7 4,460,392 \u2248 749,345,856  \n\u2003\u2003\u20033. Efficiency Score = 2,660.35 NEAR / 749,345,856 \u2248 3.55 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 NEAR per fee unit  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003This very low figure indicates that, in \u201craw\u201d terms, the value being transferred is extremely small relative to the collective gas cost \u201cfootprint.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Caveat & Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003As noted previously in part 2.C, the numeric values for gas price and gas used are likely scaled differently than NEAR token amounts. Nevertheless, if the ratio were to be taken at face value, it would imply that the fee overhead easily dwarfs the transaction\u2019s economic value.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Actionable Insight: It may be worthwhile to revisit the fee model or develop aggregation protocols (batching micro-transactions) to improve economic throughput and to ensure that fee structures do not discourage users from engaging in economically meaningful transactions.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion and Actionable Summary\n\n\u2022 User Engagement is healthy with an average of 7.52 transactions per user, yet the transactions are extremely low in value. This may call for applications that either bundle micro-transactions or promote higher-value interactions.  \n\u2022 A perfect 100% success rate reinforces operational stability, but the very low smart contract interaction density (0.6%) indicates significant room for growth in dApp activity.  \n\u2022 The cost structure calculation yields a cost ratio of roughly 281,879 (gas fee units per transaction value), cautioning that\u2014if fee units are directly comparable\u2014the fee model may not be optimized for micro-transactions. A re\u2011evaluation of unit conversions and fee mechanics is suggested.  \n\u2022 The computed economic efficiency score (\u2248 3.55 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076) reinforces the idea that the economic \u201cpayload\u201d per transaction is minuscule compared to the operational (gas) overhead.  \n\u2022 Finally, while an estimated network utilization of around 44.6% (assuming a 10,000,000 daily Tx capacity) seems moderate, continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure scaling keeps pace with activity.\n\nFor blockchain economists and network designers, these indicators suggest that while NEAR is operating very efficiently from a technical perspective (low gas usage, high success rate), there is a need to drive richer economic interactions and smart contract use. Investigating fee scaling, enhancing dApp ecosystems, and facilitating value aggregation can improve both the economic and user experience on the network.\n\nEach of these step-by-step calculations ([Daily_Transactions], [Unique_Users], [Average_Gas_Used], [Average_Transaction_Value], etc.) provides actionable pointers to further refine and improve NEAR\u2019s growth and sustainability in a competitive blockchain landscape."}

[contract_interactions]\nActionable Insight:  \n\u2022 To stimulate dApp growth and drive user value beyond simple transfers, NEAR could benefit from further incentivizing smart contract development (for example, through grants, hackathons, or reduced fees for contract interactions).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nd) Network Economic Efficiency Score  \n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nStep 3.4. One quantitative measure of economic efficiency is the ratio of the economic value moved to the cumulative gas cost. Alternatively, one can use the per-transaction measure:  \n\u2003\u2003Economic Efficiency (per transaction) = Average Transaction Value / (Average Gas Used \u00d7 Average Gas Price)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.000596 NEAR / (6 \u00d7 30)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 0.000596 / 180  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 3.31 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 NEAR per gas cost unit\n\nOr, from a daily perspective:  \n\u2003\u2003Total Economic Efficiency = Total Volume / Total Daily Gas Cost  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 4,374.04 NEAR / 1,320,444,360  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 3.31 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 NEAR per gas cost unit\n\nSignificance:  \n\u2022 This extremely small ratio reflects that, under current conditions, the average economic value transferred is very low compared to the gas cost \u201cunits\u201d incurred.  \n\u2022 For a network optimized for microtransactions, such a ratio is expected; however, if users find that fees form too large a proportion of transfer value, they may be disincentivized for higher-value transfers. [average_txn_value], [average_gas_used], [average_gas_price]\nActionable Insight:  \n\u2022 Developers and network policymakers should investigate fee models to see if further reductions or fee subsidies might be warranted for microtransaction scenarios, or alternatively, bundle transactions to improve the overall economic efficiency for end users.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nSummary & Recommendations  \n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u2022 User Engagement: With nearly 9 transactions per user and a perfect success rate, the NEAR network exhibits strong engagement and reliability. Emphasizing these strengths can help attract new users.  \n\u2022 Microtransaction Focus: The extremely low average transaction value combined with a high cost-to-value ratio signals that NEAR is presently oriented toward microtransactions. However, this also flags the potential for disproportionate fee burdens; exploring fee reduction or subsidy models may help.  \n\u2022 Underutilized Smart Contracts: At only 0.36% of transactions involving contracts, there is clear headroom for further adoption of NEAR\u2019s decentralized application ecosystem. Initiatives to boost developer activity and contract usage could drive more significant value-added services.  \n\u2022 Capacity & Efficiency: Operating at roughly 15% of an assumed maximum capacity indicates substantial scalability. The excellent gas efficiency (6 units/transaction) should be communicated as a competitive advantage with possible further improvement in fee management.  \n\u2022 Value Distribution Monitoring: Given that blockchain economies often experience high inequality, collecting more fine-grained data on the distribution of transaction values would aid in assessing economic fairness and centralization risks.\n\nThis mathematically precise and logically structured analysis points to a network that is highly reliable and efficient for high\u2010frequency, low\u2011value operations while simultaneously highlighting opportunities for increasing smart contract involvement and rethinking fee structures. Actionable steps for network participants include encouraging dApp adoption, optimizing fee models, and further monitoring economic fairness on the network."}
