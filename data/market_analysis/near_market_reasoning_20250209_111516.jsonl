Here, if the numbers are directly comparable, the fee-to-value ratio is extremely imbalanced. (It is possible that the gas price and gas used are expressed in units that require further normalization; however, as given, the discrepancy is striking.)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Reevaluate the fee mechanism or its unit scaling so that users engaging in microtransactions are not overburdened by fees.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Consider dynamic fee models or fee rebates for microtransactions to improve economic feasibility.\n\n\u2003d) Projecting Daily Network Costs for Average Users  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation Steps:  \n\u2003\u2003\u20031.

For stakeholders, it means that the network could support significant scaling before congestion risks become an issue.\n\n\u2003b) Distribution of Value (Gini Coefficient Approximation)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Challenge:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Accurate Gini coefficient estimation typically requires granular data on the distribution of transaction values across addresses, which is not provided here.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Indirect Inference:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Total Value Moved = 2,660.35 NEAR distributed across 592,966 users gives an average of:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20032,660.35 \u00f7 592,966 \u2248 0.00449 NEAR per user per day  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 The very low average value per user suggests that most transactions are microtransactions.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003While microtransactions tend to be more uniformly low in value, blockchain ecosystems (in terms of wallet balances) often show significant inequality.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003For a true measure of value distribution, additional data on holdings per address would be needed; however, the current low per-user transaction value may indicate that the network is accessible for small-scale uses, even if overall wealth remains concentrated.\n\n\u2003c) Smart Contract Adoption Rate  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation Recap:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Contract Interactions Ratio = 26,637 \u00f7 4,460,392 \u2248 0.6% [contract_interactions_ratio]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003This small fraction indicates that the vast majority of transactions are simple transfers rather than interactions with deployed contracts.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003In ecosystems where decentralized applications (dApps) flourish (e.g., Ethereum during DeFi booms), the proportion of contract interactions is typically considerably higher.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003To nurture a vibrant dApp ecosystem, NEAR should consider programs (developer grants, tooling improvements, etc.) to incentivize smart contract usage and lower barriers for dApp adoption.\n\n\u2003d) Network Economic Efficiency Score  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Definition & Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003We define an \u201cEconomic Efficiency Score\u201d as the ratio of the average transaction value to the fee cost per transaction.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Step 1: Average Transaction Value = 0.000596 NEAR [avg_tx_value]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Step 2: Fee Cost per transaction = (Average Gas Price \u00d7 Average Gas Used) = 28 \u00d7 6 = 168  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Economic Efficiency Score = 0.000596 \u00f7 168 \u2248 3.55\u00d710\u207b\u2076  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Interpretation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003This extremely low score means that for every fee unit \u201cspent\u201d (or for every 168 fee-units per transaction), only 0.000596 NEAR is transferred, i.e., only about 3.55\u00d710\u207b\u2076 NEAR of value is moved per fee unit.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Healthy networks usually have fee costs that only represent a modest fraction of the transferred value to ensure user adoption and cost-effectiveness.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Such a low efficiency score (assuming the numbers are directly comparable) should prompt NEAR\u2019s economic model reviewers to revisit fee scaling\u2014especially when microtransactions dominate\u2014to ensure that fees do not outweigh the transactional value and deter user participation.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nSummary of Actionable Insights\n\n\u2022 The average user is engaging in roughly 7.5 transactions per day; however, the overall transferred value is extremely low, hinting at a microtransaction-heavy ecosystem. Consider ways to aggregate or increase transaction sizes.\n  \n\u2022 A 100% success rate reflects excellent network reliability, but as usage increases, continuous monitoring is essential to maintain this level.\n\n\u2022 The very low (\u22480.6%) ratio of contract interactions suggests an opportunity to further develop and promote dApps on the network.\n\n\u2022 With unique receiver to user ratio of nearly 3.86, the network demonstrates wide interactivity, yet further research into wallet balance distributions (to assess inequality) is recommended.\n\n\u2022 The computed fee-to-value structure (with a cost-to-transaction value ratio of approximately 281,879) and an economic efficiency score of about 3.55\u00d710\u207b\u2076 indicate that, if taken at face value, fees are disproportionately high relative to the transaction values. This imbalance needs addressing for the network to remain attractive for microtransaction-based use cases.\n\n\u2022 Assuming a maximum capacity of 1,000 transactions per second, the current utilization of about 5% signals ample scalability for future growth.\n\nOverall, while the network shows strong reliability and broad interaction among many users, there exist significant economic challenges (especially when current fee cost metrics are compared with very small transaction values). Adjusting fee structures and encouraging more contract-based interactions can drive both user value and ecosystem development. Continued detailed monitoring and further granular data (especially on fee units and distribution of wallet balances) would be advisable for a more comprehensive economic assessment.\n\nEach of these insights contributes to a clearer strategy for both users and developers looking to optimize their participation in the NEAR ecosystem."}

In healthy networks, a ratio above 1 confirms that users are active but a very high ratio may indicate either intense daily use or a prevalence of automated/microtransactions. Here, 8.84 is moderately high, suggesting that users are engaging actively, perhaps repeatedly transacting small amounts.\n\n\u2003\u2003b) Success Rate and Throughput  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Fact: Success Rate = 100.0%  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Explanation: A 100% success rate means every submitted transaction is processed without failure.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Impact: When success rate is perfect, the effective throughput equals the raw transaction count (7.33 million).

In comparison, mature DeFi or NFT platforms may feature a much higher proportion if dApps are widely used. This low percentage suggests that the network is mostly used for simple transfers rather than complex contract calls. For actionable insights, developers and community managers might wish to foster more dApp usage to increase smart contract adoption.\n\n\u2003\u2003d) Unique Receivers to Unique Users Ratio  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Unique Receivers = 3,371,208  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Unique Users = 829,661  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Ratio = 3,371,208 \u00f7 829,661 \u2248 4.06 [receivers_users_ratio]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance: On average, each active user is linked (as sender or indirectly via interactions) with about 4 different receivers. This dispersion indicates a broad distribution of funds among accounts, supporting the idea that the network reaches a wide set of participants and is not concentrated among a few \u201chubs.\u201d\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n2. Economic Metrics Analysis\n\n\u2003\u2003a) Total Economic Value Moved  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 With a 100% success rate, the effective economic volume is simply the reported total volume.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Total Economic Value = Total Volume \u00d7 Success Rate = 4,374.04 NEAR \u00d7 1 = 4,374.04 NEAR [total_economic_value]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance: Every unit of the reported volume is realized \u2013 a positive sign in ensuring that fees and value transfers are indeed \u201cmoving\u201d on the network.\n\n\u2003\u2003b) Gas Efficiency Ratio  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Definition: Average gas used per successful transaction.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation: The provided average gas used is 6 units per transaction. Since the success rate is 100%, each transaction uses 6 gas units on average.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance: Low gas consumption per transaction is typically a network strength because it keeps transaction overhead low. However, note that the absolute number \u201c6\u201d must be interpreted relative to the NEAR platform\u2019s standard units. As given, it indicates high efficiency in gas usage per transaction.\n\n\u2003\u2003c) Cost Structure of Transaction Fees  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Definition: This ratio compares the fee cost (gas_price \u00d7 gas_used) to the average transaction value.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation Steps:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20031. Fee per Transaction = Average Gas Used \u00d7 Average Gas Price = 6 \u00d7 30 = 180 (fee units)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20032. Average Transaction Value = 0.000596 NEAR  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20033. Cost Structure Ratio = Fee per Transaction \u00f7 Average Transaction Value  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 180 \u00f7 0.000596 \u2248 302,010 [fee_structure_ratio]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance: This result indicates that, on average, the fee \u201ccost\u201d is about 302,010 times the value transferred. In standard blockchain scenarios, fees are expected to be a small fraction of the transacted value. Such a high multiplier suggests one of two possibilities:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 The reported transaction values are extremely tiny (microtransactions), or  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 The fee units may be denominated in a different scale (or there is a conversion factor not shown here).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight: If these figures are taken at face value, this disproportion suggests that microtransactions may be economically unsustainable unless fee structure adjustments or fee subsidies are introduced. Increasing average transaction values or rebalancing gas pricing may be necessary for encouraging more robust economic activity on the network.\n\n\u2003\u2003d) Daily Network Costs for an Average User  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Assumptions:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 We already saw that an average user makes about 8.84 transactions per day (from Part 1a).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Cost per transaction in fee units = 6 \u00d7 30 = 180.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Daily Cost per User = 180 \u00d7 8.84 \u2248 1,591.2 fee units [daily_user_cost]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance: On a per-user basis, ~1,591 fee units are \u201cexpended\u201d each day. Without additional context on how fee units convert to NEAR or their real-world cost, this number highlights that even if individual transactions carry a very small nominal value (0.000596 NEAR), the cost measured in terms of gas factors is relatively high. This discrepancy calls for a review of fee pricing or a focus on applications where higher transaction values justify the fee cost.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \n3. Market Health Indicators\n\n\u2003\u2003a) Network Utilization Rate  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Definition: Utilization rate generally compares current actual throughput (transactions per day) with the network\u2019s maximum capacity.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003While the maximum capacity for NEAR isn\u2019t provided, we can offer a hypothetical scenario. For example, if NEAR\u2019s daily capacity were roughly 20 million transactions, then Utilization = 7,335,802 \u00f7 20,000,000 \u2248 0.3678, or about 36.8% [network_utilization].  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance: A utilization rate in the 30\u201340% range (if capacity is indeed 20 million) points to moderate usage, and implies that the network is not congested. If the capacity were lower (say 10 million), the utilization would be higher (~73.4%) which could indicate approaching limits.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight: To understand scalability needs, it is important for stakeholders to know the actual network capacity; however, the provided data suggests that there is room for growth without overwhelming the network.\n\n\u2003\u2003b) Distribution of Value (Gini Coefficient Approximation)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Definition: The Gini coefficient is a common measure of inequality, but it requires detailed value distribution data (often wallet balances or transaction amounts per account).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Available Data:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Total Volume: 4,374.04 NEAR  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Unique Receivers: 3,371,208  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Rough Approximation: If the volume were evenly distributed among receivers, the average amount per receiver = 4,374.04 \u00f7 3,371,208 \u2248 0.001297 NEAR. However, blockchain economies tend to follow Pareto (unequal) distributions.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance: Although we cannot compute a precise Gini coefficient with these aggregates, the fact that there are more than four times as many receiver accounts as active users suggests that many accounts receive very low amounts, while a few may capture higher volumes \u2013 a pattern that might result in a moderately high inequality index (a rough, qualitative guess might be in the range of 0.6\u20130.7).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight: For a healthy network, encouraging broader distribution (and perhaps even measuring wallet balances more granularly) can help improve financial inclusion and signal network robustness.\n\n\u2003\u2003c) Smart Contract Adoption Rate  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation: As computed earlier, Contract Interactions represent about 0.36% of all transactions.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Smart Contract Adoption Rate = 26,479 \u00f7 7,335,802 \u2248 0.00361 (or 0.36%) [smart_contract_rate]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance: In ecosystems driven by DeFi, NFTs, and dApps, one might expect a larger share of transactions to hit smart contracts \u2013 sometimes 30% or higher. A 0.36% rate suggests that the network is predominantly used for basic transfers rather than sophisticated dApp interactions.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight: To foster long\u2010term growth, initiatives that promote dApp development and smart contract usage could shift this ratio upward, driving ecosystem expansion and value-added services.\n\n\u2003\u2003d) Network Economic Efficiency Score  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Definition: One way to define an \u201ceconomic efficiency score\u201d is the ratio of total economic value moved to the aggregate fee cost (measured as gas used multiplied by gas price).  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Calculation Steps:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20031. Total Fee Cost per Day = Daily Transactions \u00d7 (Gas Used per Transaction \u00d7 Gas Price)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 7,335,802 \u00d7 (6 \u00d7 30)  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 7,335,802 \u00d7 180  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 1,320,444,360 fee units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20032. Economic Efficiency Score = Total Volume \u00f7 Total Fee Cost  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 4,374.04 NEAR \u00f7 1,320,444,360  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 3.31 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 NEAR per fee unit [economic_efficiency]  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Significance: This extremely low ratio means that for every single \u201cunit\u201d of gas fee paid, only 3.31 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 NEAR of transactional value is moved. In healthy networks, one expects the fees paid to be a small fraction relative to the monetary value transferred\u2014not the reverse.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Actionable Insight: This inefficiency (or the appearance thereof) hints that either the average transaction values are extremely micro in nature or that the fee structure (in these reported units) is not well aligned with the size of economic transfers. If these numbers are accurate on a \u201cper NEAR\u201d basis, then the network might need to adjust fee mechanisms or target higher-value use cases to avoid inhibiting user adoption.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500  \nSummary and Actionable Insights\n\n\u2022 Users are quite active\u2014with about 8.84 transactions per unique user\u2014and the network reliably processes them (100% success rate). However, the very low volume per transaction (0.000596 NEAR on average) combined with a fee (6 gas \u00d7 30 = 180 fee units) that appears disproportionately high relative to transaction value (ratio \u2248 302,010) requires attention.  \n\u2022 Contract interactions comprise only 0.36% of all transactions; increasing dApp activities could boost ecosystem utility.  \n\u2022 With an approximate unique receivers-to-users ratio of 4.06, the network is fairly well distributed, though preliminary analysis suggests a possibly unequal value distribution warranting further investigation using detailed wallet data.  \n\u2022 The network\u2019s economic efficiency score (\u2248 3.31 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 NEAR per fee unit) underlines that if fees are measured in comparable NEAR terms, low value transfers are being \u201covercharged\u201d in fee terms.  \n\u2022 Stakeholders and developers should consider fee adjustments, foster higher-value transactions or bundled transfers, and work to stimulate smart contract adoption to ensure network costs are justified by economic throughput.\n\nThis mathematically explicit and quantitatively backed analysis should help users, developers, and network designers understand where inefficiencies may lie and what levers (dApp ecosystem growth, fee structure adjustments, and transaction aggregation) might be pulled to improve NEAR\u2019s market health and economic viability."}
